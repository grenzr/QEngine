/* Serves a fake devicetree, and a usable /proc/interrupts, to an emulated Engine.
 *
 * One source, two SoCs. Everything that matters here -- the open/openat/fopen and
 * write interposition, the runtime /proc/interrupts generation and its IRQ
 * affinity probing, the /dev/mem neutering -- is the same on both, which is why
 * this was two files that had diverged rather than two different shims. Define
 * SOC_RK3588 or SOC_RK3288 to pick which devicetree properties it serves; that
 * choice is the whole of the difference, and it lives in DT_REMAPS below.
 *
 * How the two devicetrees differ, for the record:
 *   - product-code is "RMZ2" on RK3588; JC11/JP11/JP14 and relatives on RK3288
 *   - no inmusic,az01-pcb-rev property exists in RMZ2's devicetree
 *   - the panel/rotation node lives at dsi@... or edp-panel on RK3588, and at
 *     mipi@ff960000 on RK3288
 *   - no chosen/inmusic,internal-sd-fitted property on RK3588
 *
 * Two things the RK3288 original carried that neither build wants any more:
 *   - the Qt5-ABI stub symbols are gone: this build is
 *     Qt 6.7.2, a different ABI, and that missing-symbol issue was never
 *     observed here
 *   - the eglCreateWindowSurface/eglSurfaceAttrib
 *     interception (a workaround for a RK3288-era fbdev_window/single-buffer
 *     quirk) is gone too: on this build it actively broke KMS scanout —
 *     eglSwapBuffers kept succeeding but nothing ever reached the screen,
 *     because forcing EGL_SINGLE_BUFFER and re-wrapping the window handle in
 *     a second, shim-created gbm_surface fights Qt6's own eglfs-kms-gbm
 *     backend, which already creates and tracks its own GBM surface/pageflip
 *     correctly on its own. Removing it fixed the blank-screen symptom.
 *
 * /proc/interrupts handling:
 * Engine hard-throws (uncaught std::runtime_error, aborts the process) if it
 * can't find a real-hardware IRQ line by name for six components QEMU's virt
 * machine doesn't emulate: dwc3, fe210000.sata, fea10000.dma-controller,
 * ff0c0000.dwmmc, ff0f0000.dwmmc, ttyS0. Immediately after finding each one
 * by name, Engine also writes CPU affinity to the matching
 * /proc/irq/<N>/smp_affinity, so whatever number we hand back has to be a
 * real, currently-live, writable IRQ too — a static pre-generated fake file
 * (the old approach, still present as a last-resort fallback in
 * fake-dt-rmz2/interrupts) goes stale the moment the QEMU device list
 * changes, since IRQ/MSI-vector numbers are assigned dynamically at boot
 * based on exactly which devices are present and in what order. Instead,
 * generate the fake content at runtime: read the real /proc/interrupts,
 * pick real IRQs that are (a) MSI-routed edge interrupts — the category
 * every virtio/USB-class device IRQ we've observed under this QEMU setup
 * falls into and reliably accepts affinity writes on (matches both the
 * plain "MSI" label this kernel uses and "ITS-MSI", seen on others — the
 * exact controller label varies by kernel build) — and (b) verified
 * writable by an actual no-op read-then-write-back probe (not just a
 * permission check; a GPIO-backed IRQ tried early in this project rejected
 * the write with EIO despite passing access(W_OK)), then relabel six of
 * them with the fake names Engine is looking for. Picked once per process
 * and cached, so repeated lookups within one boot stay consistent.
 *
 * That probe alone isn't sufficient, though — confirmed directly: an IRQ
 * that passes the probe at /proc/interrupts-read time can still reject
 * Engine's own affinity write moments later with the exact same EPERM,
 * because the underlying real device (whatever the fake name actually
 * landed on — an MSI vector genuinely owned by some virtio device) can
 * transition from freely-reaffinitizable to pinned once its own driver
 * finishes initializing, which happens on its own schedule, independent
 * of when Engine gets around to setting affinity for our fake names. A
 * second probe right before the real write wouldn't close this gap
 * either, just shrink it. Since the whole device is already fictional
 * (there's no real dwc3/dma-controller/etc. under QEMU at all), the
 * write() interceptor below fakes success for smp_affinity/
 * smp_affinity_list writes targeting the six real IRQ numbers we mapped,
 * the same way open()/fopen() already fake the device's existence —
 * consistent, and immune to the timing issue since it never depends on
 * whether the real kernel would have actually accepted the write.
