# new_instance.sh — create a self-contained emulator instance, in the spirit of
# an Android AVD: one directory per emulated device, holding its own disks and
# its own configuration, so many devices can be built and run side by side
# without overwriting each other.
#
# Without this, every build writes build/rootfs_out.img and every launcher opens
# that same path on port 2225, so a second device silently clobbers the first and
# a second VM fails to bind (or worse, two QEMUs write one disk).
#
# Usage: new_instance.sh --name <name> --firmware <image>
#                        [--device <engine|mpc>] [--size <bytes>] [--force]
#                        [--ssh-key <pubkey file>]
#   --name      instance name, e.g. rmz2-5.0.4 or mpc-3.9.1
#   --device    which device family the firmware is for. Optional: when omitted it
#               is identified from the firmware itself, which costs one extra
#               extraction (a few seconds). Pass it to skip that, or to state the
#               intent explicitly — a wrong value is still caught either way.
#                 engine = Engine OS (RANE SYSTEM ONE and relatives)
#                 mpc    = Akai MPC
#               Passing --device engine does not skip the extraction: Engine OS
#               ships on both architectures and they need different builders, so
#               the firmware still has to be looked at to tell which.
#   --firmware  path to the firmware .img to extract
#   --size      rootfs image size in bytes, passed through to the builder
#   --product-code  which device identity to spoof, e.g. JP14, RMZ2, ACV5. Passed to
#               the builder as PRODUCT_CODE and recorded in instance.env, so a later
#               --force rebuild keeps it instead of silently reverting to the
#               builder's default. Omit to keep what this instance already has, or
#               to take the builder's default on a new instance.
#   --force     rebuild the rootfs even if this instance already has one
#   --ssh-key   path to an OpenSSH public key to install for root. Opt-in: also
#               enables sshd (the firmware ships it disabled). The key content is

#   <family>|<arch>|<rootfs markers>|<rootfs builder>|<disk layout>|<data image name>
#
# The markers are paths that must ALL exist in the built rootfs for the row to
# match, space separated, so a family that needs more than one piece of evidence
# just lists more. Rows are tried in order, which lets a future family whose
# markers are a superset of another's be listed first and win. Adding a device
# family or a new architecture for one means adding a row; none of the logic below
# changes.
#
# The markers are what the family actually is, not a guess from the filename or the
# product code: /usr/Engine is the Engine install tree, /usr/bin/MPC is the MPC
# application binary itself. They do not distinguish the architecture — the same
# Engine tree ships on both — so arch comes from the dynamic loader instead
# (detect_arch below).
#
# Architecture is part of the key because two things genuinely differ along it and
# not along the family. Engine OS on armv7 needs its own rootfs builder (a different
# shim stack: no alsashim/midisurface/controllermap, and RK3288 devicetree paths),
# and it wants the single-partition 'mpc' disk layout rather than the RK3588
# data+factory pair, because its data.mount asks for PARTUUID
# 931ad49d-ad59-0849-833a-9bf00af5b60e. Disk layout tracks the platform generation,
# not the application.
