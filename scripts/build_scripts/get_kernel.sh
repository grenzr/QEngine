# get_kernel.sh — builds a Debian trixie (13) kernel and initrd for booting this
# project's targets under QEMU, with the modules it actually needs bundled in.
#
# Usage: get_kernel.sh --arch <arm64|armhf>
#   arm64 boots the RK3588 targets (RANE SYSTEM ONE / RMZ2), armhf the RK3288 ones
#   (Akai MPC, and the armv7 Engine OS devices).
#   Writes vmlinuz-generic-<arch> and initrd-generic-<arch> to the repo's build/.
#   Requires Docker.
#
# This was two scripts, get_arm64_kernel.sh and get_armv7_kernel.sh, differing in 48
# lines of 360: the package name, the Docker platform, the output names, the container
# architecture assertion, and three extra modules the armhf kernel needs. Those are
# the six values below; everything else was the same text twice. The old names remain
# as wrappers, since BUILD_ARM64.md and BUILD_MPC.md tell readers to run them.
