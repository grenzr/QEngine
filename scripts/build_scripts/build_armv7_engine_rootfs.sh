#!/bin/bash
# Automates extraction and modification of a stock *armv7 / RK3288* Engine OS rootfs
# for QEngine.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Extract the rootfs partition out of the firmware image with binwalk 3.
#   2. Grow the image and its filesystem to a runtime-usable size.
#   3. Block telemetry (docs/BLOCKING_TELEMETRY.md).
#   4. Build the dtshim/drmatomic/touchbridge shims for armhf. Only dtshim is
#      RK3288-specific; the other two compile from the RK3588 sources unmodified.
#   5. Copy those shims + fake-dt files into /root.
#   6. Wire touchbridge.service, midisurface.service (virtual control
#      surface) and an engine.service.d override so
#      engine.service actually loads the shims and starts eglfs.
#   7. Blank the root password for passwordless serial-console login, and
#      disable the tty1 getty so stray keystrokes can't reach a hidden root
#      shell behind the fullscreen display.
#
# Nothing is staged into /usr/lib — this rootfs already ships everything the
# graphics stack needs, and step 6's environment is what points Qt and Mesa at it.
# See the note above the shim install for the two things that were staged while
# that was still being worked out, and why neither is needed.
#
# Not carried over from the arm64 build: controllermap, which exists to swap a
# real USB controller's assignment files in and hardcodes RMZ2's directory.
#
# Usage: build_armv7_engine_rootfs.sh [--firmware <path>] [--out <path>]
#                               [--size <bytes>] [--force]
#   --firmware  Firmware .img to extract from.
#   --out       Output rootfs image path. Default: build/rootfs_out.img
#   --size      Final image size in bytes. Default: 4294967296 (4GiB)
#   --force     Overwrite --out if it already exists.
#
# Environment:
#   PRODUCT_CODE  which of this image's device identities to spoof. Default JP07.
#
# Requires: binwalk (3.x), qemu-img, docker.
