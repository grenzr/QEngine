# Resolves the QEMU binary and the architecture-dependent half of the command
# line, so one launcher per device family can serve both architectures. ARCH is

# arm64, so a launcher run standalone behaves exactly as it did before.
#
# This used to be a much wider split: armhf attached everything over virtio-mmio,
# because on the 32-bit `virt` machine the PCI host bridge failed to probe at all —
#
#   pci-host-generic 4010000000.pcie: probe with driver pci-host-generic failed
#   with error -75
#
# — which made every `-pci` device invisible in the guest, USB controllers included.
# That is a memory-map problem, not a missing driver, and `highmem=off` fixes it
# (see the armhf branch below), so both architectures now use the same PCI devices.
# What still differs is the machine's highmem flag, the amount of RAM that flag
# allows, the CPU, the accelerator, and the sound card -- that last one because of
# what Debian builds for each architecture rather than because of the machine; see
# arch_audio_devices at the bottom.

# Engine wants a playback-only card: a capture PCM makes it assign capture as the
# default and leave playback null, which presents as a stuck XRUN rather than an
# error (see the note in each engine launcher).
#
# The card differs by architecture, and not by choice: Debian builds
# snd_hda_intel for linux-image-arm64 but not for linux-image-armmp. The armhf
# kernel ships the whole HDA codec family (snd_hda_core, snd_hda_codec,
# snd_hda_codec_generic, even snd_hda_tegra) without the Intel/PCI controller
# driver, so nothing in a 32-bit guest can ever bind ich9-intel-hda. The card
# simply never appears: snd_card_next() returns nothing, alsashim's name spoof is
# never called because there is no card to ask about, and the visible symptoms are
# a step removed from the cause -- Engine failing to resolve
# /sys/class/sound/card0/device, and alsa-lib reporting "Cannot get card index for
# 0". This is not a highmem/PCI problem; PCI works here now, and an ich9-intel-hda
# is enumerated on the bus with no driver to claim it.
#
# So armhf gets virtio-sound instead, whose driver (virtio_snd) *is* built for both
# architectures and is in the initrd get_kernel.sh builds. arm64 keeps hda, which
# is what its audio was developed and confirmed against; there is no reason to move
# a working guest onto a second device model.
#
# streams=1 is the virtio-sound equivalent of pairing hda with hda-output rather
# than hda-duplex, and it is required for the same reason: Engine takes the first
# device of each enumeration pass as its default, the capture pass runs second, so
# any capture PCM wins the default and leaves playback unassigned and silent.
# QEMU assigns directions by index -- `stream_id < streams / 2 + (streams & 1)` is
# output, the rest input (hw/audio/virtio-snd.c) -- so the default streams=2 gives
# one of each, and streams=1 gives a single playback stream and no capture.
#
# virtio-sound advertises S8/U8/S16/U16/S32/U32/FLOAT at every rate from 5512 to
# 384000, which is a superset of what the emulated HDA card offered, so alsashim's
