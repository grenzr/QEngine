#!/bin/bash
# Boot an emulated inMusic device in QEMU. One command line, with the parts that vary
# resolved from the environment rather than by copying the file.
#
# Normally reached through scripts/qemu/run_instance.sh, which reads these values out
# of an instance's instance.env. Run it directly by setting them yourself.
#
#   DEVICE        engine | mpc      which shim stack the guest has, and so whether it
#                                   gets an audio card
#   DISPLAY_MODE  see display_modes.sh
#   ARCH          arm64 | armhf     machine type and device models, see arch_devices.sh
#
# Anything else the wrappers used to hardcode is an override with the same default:
# ROOTFS_IMG, DATA_IMG, KERNEL_IMG, INITRD_IMG, SSH_PORT, VNC_DISPLAY, QEMU_BIN,
# ACCEL, CPU, MEM, SMP, RENDERNODE, KERNEL_EXTRA_ARGS.
#
# This replaced seven near-identical launcher scripts. They differed only in the two
# values above and in whether the display backend needed GL, and the copies had
# already drifted: two of them disagreed about which audio backend a VNC session uses.
#
# Audio, for the engine family: hda-output (playback-only), NOT hda-duplex. Engine
# marks the first device of each enumeration pass as its default, and the capture
# pass runs second — so when a capture PCM exists it becomes the default, gets
# assigned as the input device, and the playback slot is left null. Engine then
# drives capture only and never feeds playback, which shows up as a stuck XRUN and a
# frozen "Audio_probe" watchdog rather than any error. Playback-only removes the
# ambiguity. Requires alsashim.so preloaded into engine.service (see
# build_arm64_rootfs.sh) — without it Engine rejects the card on name alone.
